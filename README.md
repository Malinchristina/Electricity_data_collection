## Introduction

This data collection aims for landlords in Sweden to calculate what the tenant shall pay for the monthly electricity usage. The data collection is a mix of information from the electricity supplier and the landlord's electricity meter. The data is stored in a Google sheet and also provided directly in the terminal.

### Site goals

To provide a simple data collection to calculate the cost of electricity monthly usage.

### Target audience

Landlords with one electricity meter and a tenant who wants to charge them for their electricity usage.

## Features
